# TTS-Generator
 TTS-Generator can create voices by text via OpenAI API, which is simple but useful. Less code, less step, more fun. However, a valid OpenAI API is required.
 
## Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Convert any text into a spoken voice.
- **Multiple Voices**: Choose from a selection of voice types for your TTS.
- **API Key Storage**: Option to remember your API key for future visits.
- **Audio Playback**: Listen to the generated speech directly from the web interface.
- **Audio Download**: Download the generated speech as an MP3 file.
